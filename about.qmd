Hey there! I'm Kshitij Sunil Mehta, a passionate data enthusiast with a knack for storytelling through numbers.

I hail from Mumbai, where I completed my education in Computer Engineering. My journey into the realm of data began during my college years when I discovered the power of statistics and programming in unlocking hidden patterns from raw information.

Beyond data, I enjoy playing soccer and traveling and exploring different countries.

Over the years, I've had the privilege of working on different types of data. From academic accolades to real-world projects, each milestone has fueled my passion for continuous learning and growth in the field of data science.
