In this analysis, we delve into a comprehensive healthcare dataset, exploring patterns in patient demographics, medical conditions, and healthcare costs. This analysis aims to uncover insights that could inform better healthcare management and policy-making.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the dataset
healthcare_data <- read_csv("/Users/kshitijmehta/Desktop/is407/KshitijBlog/data/healthcare_dataset.csv")

# Clean the data by removing rows with any missing information in crucial columns
healthcare_data <- healthcare_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(Age) & !is.na(Gender) & Gender != "" & 
         !is.na(`Medical Condition`) & `Medical Condition` != "" & 
         !is.na(`Billing Amount`) & `Billing Amount` > 0)

# Display the structure and the first few rows of the dataset
glimpse(healthcare_data)
head(healthcare_data)
```

## **Analysis 1: Age Distribution of Patients**

```{r}
# Plot the age distribution of the patients
ggplot(healthcare_data, aes(x=Age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill="blue", color="black") +
  labs(title="Age Distribution of Patients", x="Age", y="Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## **Analysis 2: Medical Condition Frequency**

```{r}
# Summarize medical conditions frequency
condition_freq <- healthcare_data %>%
  group_by(`Medical Condition`) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Count))

# Plot the frequency of medical conditions
ggplot(condition_freq, aes(x=reorder(`Medical Condition`, Count), y=Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="green") +
  labs(title="Frequency of Medical Conditions", x="Medical Condition", y="Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()
```

## **Analysis 3: Healthcare Costs Analysis**

```{r}
# Plot the distribution of billing amounts
ggplot(healthcare_data, aes(x=`Billing Amount`)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000, fill="purple", color="black") +
  labs(title="Billing Amount Distribution", x="Billing Amount", y="Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## **Analysis 4: Admission Type Distribution**

```{r}
# Summarize admission types
admission_type_freq <- healthcare_data %>%
  group_by(`Admission Type`) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Count))

# Plot the distribution of admission types
ggplot(admission_type_freq, aes(x=`Admission Type`, y=Count, fill=`Admission Type`)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  labs(title="Admission Type Distribution", x="Admission Type", y="Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

In this analysis, we explored the healthcare dataset. Key findings include a wide age range among patients with conditions like Asthma,Cancer and Hypertension.These insights are critical for better healthcare management and policy-making.
